- **Battle Mode**: Compete against AI opponents in tandem drift battles, where players are judged based on their drifting performance.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Race against friends or other players online to see who can execute the best drifts.

Key customization features include:
- **Engine Swaps**: Players can replace the stock engine of their car with more powerful options, giving them a performance boost on the track.
